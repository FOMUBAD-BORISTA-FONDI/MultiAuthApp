## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

## **Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **PHP (>= 8.0)**  
- **Composer**  
- **MySQL / MariaDB**  
- **Node.js** (for frontend assets)  
- **Git**

---

## **Installation**

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

To clone this project to your local machine, open a terminal and run:

git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/MultiAuthApp.git
cd MultiAuthApp

### 2. **Install PHP Dependencies**

Run the following command to install Laravelâ€™s PHP dependencies using Composer:

composer install

### 3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

You will need to install frontend dependencies using **npm** (Node.js package manager):

npm install

---

## **Configuration**

### 1. **Create `.env` File**

Laravel uses an `.env` file to manage environment-specific settings. To create the `.env` file, copy the example file:

cp .env.example .env

### 2. **Generate Application Key**

Laravel requires an application key. Run the following command to generate it:

php artisan key:generate

### 3. **Set Up Database**

Make sure you have MySQL (or MariaDB) running. Update your `.env` file with the correct database configuration:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_password

### 4. **Migrate Database**

Run migrations to set up the required tables in your database:

php artisan migrate

### 5. **Seed the Database**

You can seed the database with an admin user by running the following command:

php artisan db:seed --class=AdminSeeder

---

## **Testing the Application**

### 1. **Start the Development Server**

Once everything is set up, you can start the Laravel development server:

php artisan serve

The application should now be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. **Access the Application**

- **Admin Login:** The admin credentials can be found in the `AdminSeeder.php` file. By default, the admin user is:
  - Email: `admin@example.com`
  - Password: `password`
  
- **User Login:** You can register a user through the registration page or use the default user credentials.

---

## **Usage**

- Admin users will be directed to the admin dashboard, while regular users will be directed to the user dashboard.
- You can customize the user roles or authentication logic based on your needs.
